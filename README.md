## General info

Personal portfolio which I've written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Includes 5 categories: Programming, Graphics Design, Photography, Game Photography, Personal Technology Blog.

This whole page is only a single .html file. I've written a script in JavaScript that automatically generates the thumbnails, titles, descriptions, links and contents of all the categories from a single .JSON file and using a single function - just because I always wanted to learn how to do it.

You only need to click a button from one of the 5 categories and the script will take care of the rest.
If you wish to go back to this intro text, just click the "Michael ReznoR's Projects" text at the top or reload the page.

Have fun! :)
