            <h2>Hi! My name is Michał Stefaniak.</h2>

            <p>An enthusiastic, friendly, self-educated person currently offering his humble programming skills as a helping hand to an experienced mentor who would kindly take me under their wing - for a free or paid intern.</p>

            <p>If you need an employee who is always open for new challenges, likes solving logical problems, helping other people, loves constant self-improvement, reading, writing and learning new things, has attention to details, likes to push his boundaries - I'm that person.</p>
            
            <p>I'm a quick and eager learner, very motivated to pursue my strongest childhood dream - work professionally as a programmer. I could take just about anything and learn in practice, because practice was always the best teacher for me. I'm open for learning all necessary languages, frameworks and tools.</p>

            <p>In exchange I can offer you many varied skills and experience - my life was full of self-education in practice. In my previous job I had many different roles at once from which my experience could become useful. Since November 2018 I'm learning C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, WordPress, Bootstrap, Git. Currently Laravel 5.7.</p>
            
            <p>if(place to sit && task to work on) I will be totally happy to help you and honoured to learn from the best :) else never stop trying.</p>

            <p>More info about me is organized on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-stefaniak/" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
