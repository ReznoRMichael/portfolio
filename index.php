            <h2>Hi! My name is Michał Stefaniak.</h2>

            <p>An enthusiastic, self-educated former Lead Graphic Designer currently offering his humble skills as a helping hand to an experienced mentor who would take me under his/her wing - for free or on a paid intern.</p>

            <p>In exchange I can offer you many varied skills and experience - my life forced me to self-education in PCs, IT support, graphic design, photography, games and writing guides about technology, audio, hardware, software. In my previous job I had many different roles at once from which my experience could become useful (all are mentioned in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-stefaniak/" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>). Since November 2018 I'm learning programming to pursue my strongest childhood dream that previously wasn't possible for me to achieve.</p>

            <p>If you need someone who always enjoys a challenge, solving logical problems, helping other people, loves constant self-improvement, reading, writing and learning new things + has attention to details - I'm that person.</p>

            <p>if(place to sit && task to work on) I will be totally happy to help you and honoured to learn new things from the best :) else never stop trying.</p>

            <p>My end goal and dream since childhood? To be a programmer - preferably to work in a team of great people on back-end and multiplatform apps that could improve many people's lives. If I learn hard enough, I believe that this dream could one day become reality.</p>
